<div"><p class="paras">This bass was the Majority Bassist's first bass, the Squier Affinity PJ Bass, bought in 2015. When drop tuned to anything lower than drop D, the pickups of this bass can't deal with it, and it sounds rubbish.</p><</div>

<div"><p class="paras">This second bass is a Fender Dimension Deluxe V, made in Mexico and one of the last models before the Dimension line was discontinued. It has a standard 34 inch scale length, meaning drop tuning it isn't great unless you use thicker strings. It has 2 active humbuckers which makes playing metal amazing. It also features a 5 way switch and 3 band active EQ, making any tone easy to get.</p><</div>

<div"><p class="paras">This third bass is a Fender Troy Sanders Signature Bass, and has an active and passive circuit allowing you to get semi-vintage tones or quote 'just like fat, big SOUND' if active. This, like the Squier, has a precision pickup and an American custom noiseless jazz pickup at the bridge, and can cope with drop tuning. It features a pan knob instead of two volume knobs or a switch, and only requires a 9V battery as although the EQ is active, the pickups are not.</p><</div>

<div"><p class="paras">This last bass is the bassist's most recent, and best looking bass. It's a Schecter J-5, a 5 string, 35 inch scale length bass with 130-45 gague strings so that the B string is tight. It's fully passive as it doesn't need to be active, and has very basic controls with one volume knob for each pickup and a tone knob. However, the unique feature of this bass is that alongside the tone knob is a push/pull switch to take it in and out of 'vintage' mode, which just makes it sound worse. The bridge allows for stringing through the body or the bridge, and the bassist strings his own through the body in order to give the bass more sustain. The neck pocket on the bass is also supposedly very nice, as the heel is contoured well to make it actually playable in the higher registers of the bass.</p><</div>

<div"><p class="paras">This Pearl Export drum set features a 14 x 5.5 inch snare drum with a 6 ply poplar and mahogany shell, creating a high volume resonance and a sustained low end punch, as well as a SR-700 throw off, allowing for the snares to be smoothly strained and loosened when necessary. The bass drum pedal allows for ultra fast chain-drive action and a high speed feel, allowing for the fast and clean drumming heard in 'Keep My Powder Dry'.</p><</div>
